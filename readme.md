# Documentation

Documentation and useful information pertaining to overall project development, agile processes, or just the group or module in general go here.

# File Formats

* Documents can be in any format - preferably MS Office or LibreOffice, LaTeX, Markdown, or plaintext.
* Scans and diagrams should be in their appropriate file formats.
* Try to keep images in JPG or PNG format.
* Other files such as FreeMind brainstorms, PowerPoint / Impress presentations, or anything you think the group would benefit from, are also more than welcome.
